# [Project 1: Credit Card Default Predictive Model](https://github.com/jmaccodes/Predictive-Modeling---Python)

This project analyzes customer credit card data to identify key variables that impact the likelihood of defaulting on credit card payments. It uses both logistic regression and a categorical decision tree model to provide insights into credit risk and help develop strategies for risk mitigation.

- Objective: Determine which factors influence the probability of credit card default using 
  statistical and machine learning models.
- Dataset: Customer credit card data containing demographic, financial, and behavioral variables.
- Methodology: Logistic regression for binary classification and statistical interpretation.
  Categorical decision tree for interpretable machine learning and visualization of decision paths.
- Key Deliverables: Trained logistic regression and decision tree models.
- Insights into significant predictors of credit default risk.
  Recommendations for risk mitigation strategies.
